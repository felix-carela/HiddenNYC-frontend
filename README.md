## How to work on this App

This app is designed for creating and managing events. Users can create events, set up event details and locations, and notify other users. Users can also edit and delete their own events, with the assurance that no other user can modify the information. To add an event, users can simply double-click on the map, which will trigger a pop-up form for entering event details. Once an event is created, it becomes viewable to others, who can only view the posted events without the ability to edit them.
